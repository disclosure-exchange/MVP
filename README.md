## Business Model
Our updated business model will be described here (coming soon).

## Code
Our code consists of a dynamic index fund composition, real market prices, and (in progress) purchasing of the fund from 130+ cryptocurrency exchanges around the world. We will make our code open source as soon as possible. For now, please see the attached code output samples from our Python code which we ran on 3-4-2019.

## Smart Contracts
Our investment contracts will (in the near future) be implemented through smart contracts.
